                            <p>When I was a kid I spent most of my time playing imaginary games.<br/><br/>
                            I&rsquo;d spend, my mother claims, 5&ndash;6 hours a day pretending to be a knight, or a wizard, or The Doctor from Doctor Who.<br/><br/>
                            I spent a lot of time doing that by myself, for sure. But I spent even more time doing it with a very close-knit group of best friends.<br/><br/>
                            We were a real swashbuckling crew: Mako, my brother, and the kid-from-down-the-street that I haven&rsquo;t spoken to in more than 10 years. We&rsquo;d spend every free moment building and inhabiting these imaginary worlds.<br/><br/>
                            These guys were my first team. The first time I got to experience the true elation of a great creative partnership.<br/><br/>
                            My creative partnerships.<br/><br/>
                            Meeting people who complete me creatively is one of life&rsquo;s greatest treasures. So, I want to tell you about 4 of the most life-changing creative partnerships I&rsquo;ve ever had.<br/><br/>
                            SPOILER: If you&rsquo;re reading this, I&rsquo;m going to ask you to do something at the end of the article. Reach out to the people you love who you&rsquo;ve made meaningful things with. Tell them how much you care about them, and how impressed you are by their brilliance.<br/><br/>
                            Ok, now onto the thing.</p>

                            <p>Tony Wang.<br/><br/>
                            Tony showed up to the first meeting I ever held when I became an editor at the school paper. He was attentive. Quiet, even. I stopped him and his friend outside the room after the meeting, asked him what he was into, and told him that this would be a great chance to develop his skills and make a difference.<br/><br/>
                            I was sure he would come back.<br/><br/>
                            He did not&#8230;at least for a while.<br/><br/>
                            About a year later he did show up again. I still haven&rsquo;t asked what possessed him to come back after a year of straight ghosting me.<br/><br/>
                            He applied for a staff position at the paper. The Editor in Chief and Creative Director didn&rsquo;t want to hire him at first &mdash; but I insisted. My logic? We don&rsquo;t have to pay staff at the student paper, so why not take him?<br/><br/>
                            That was September 2018. Three years later he&rsquo;s one of my best friends, my most frequent creative collaborator, and one of the most brilliant thinkers I&rsquo;ve ever met.<br/><br/>
                            It took us about 8&ndash;9 months of working together before we exchanged more than 5 sentences in a row. I thought he was an enigma. A quiet, mysterious, person who didn&rsquo;t jive well with my big personality.<br/><br/>
                            I learned how truly wrong I saw him do live standup comedy. I kept relearning how wrong I was &mdash; through asking him to join My Media, asking him to be the Creative Director, and ultimately seeing him flourish as a leader in the last year.<br/><br/>
                            I learned about an entirely different Tony Wang:<br/><br/>
                            He&rsquo;s extroverted, hilarious, and deeply interesting. He&rsquo;s the single most curious person that I have ever met. He is the definition of grit, hard work, and commitment.<br/><br/>
                            He catches every little mistake that I don&rsquo;t. He takes big, random, ideas &mdash; and renders them intelligible for audiences. He has a commitment to craft and perfection like nobody else.<br/><br/>
                            That&rsquo;s Tony. One of my greatest creative partners.</p>

                            <p>Wyeth Robertson.<br/><br/>
                            I didn&rsquo;t know Wyeth Robertson very well in June of 2016. I knew he had released a rap album, I knew who he was friends with, and I had shot one of his films in the 10th grade.<br/><br/>
                            So when we were sitting beside each other watching our high-school&rsquo;s annual music showcase and he said: &ldquo;You and I are gonna be up there together next year bro&rdquo;, I shrugged and gave him a real &ldquo;Ok bro, whatever you say&rdquo; kind of response.<br/><br/>
                            He was right though.<br/><br/>
                            4 months later, we started to jam after school with a couple of friends. 4 years later we&rsquo;ve put out 3 records together with the Neighbourhood Watch.<br/><br/>
                            I can&rsquo;t tell if Wyeth had a master plan all along, or if he&rsquo;s just privy to the ebs and flows of divine intervention.<br/><br/>
                            He&rsquo;s the kind of person who makes you feel like at least one of those things is true at all times.<br/><br/>
                            Wyeth is the most empathetic person I&rsquo;ve ever met. He&rsquo;s also one of the smartest. He reminds me constantly what actually matters about life: people not outcomes. He is my favourite mental sparring partner. He inspires me to live by a genuine moral compass.<br/><br/>
                            Thank you for the music that we&rsquo;ve made together. There is nothing like the spark of creative energy that we get in that jam room. Let&rsquo;s keep it alive for as long as humanly possible &mdash; it&rsquo;s the kind of joy + love that life is (probably) all about.</p>

                            <p>Ella Roy.<br/><br/>
                            I met Ella Roy in a political science conference. She was doodling in her notebooks instead of, y&rsquo;know, taking notes.<br/><br/>
                            I thought that kind of flagrant disregard for academic authority was pretty cool in an Arthur Fonzarelli-an type way &mdash; so I decided to introduce myself.<br/><br/>
                            We walked back from the political science class a couple of times talking until she mentioned that she liked graphic design. I told her about My Media, which we had just launched a couple weeks back.<br/><br/>
                            Without having seen anything she&rsquo;d done, I asked her to be part of a campaign.<br/><br/>
                            This will go down in my life as the single best instance of absolutely blind decision-making I have ever been a part of.<br/><br/>
                            She was brilliant. She rose our level of capability to a whole other level. I was blown away and excited.<br/><br/>
                            In the next year we worked together closely, constantly.<br/><br/>
                            I consistently list her as one of the most talented people I&rsquo;ve ever met. She is probably the person who is best at challenging me in my life (I react defensively usually, because I genuinely care about her opinion).<br/><br/>
                            I feel lucky to work together every day. To many more.</p>

                            <p>Ethan Surman.<br/><br/>
                            The story of how I met this guy is pretty simple. I walked upstairs, having just been interrupted by my grandma.<br/><br/>
                            I held him in my arms for 5 minutes &mdash; and then asked if I could go back to watching &ldquo;Blue&rsquo;s Clues&rdquo; (1996&ndash;2006).<br/><br/>
                            I have never disappeared into something like songwriting with Ethan. He&rsquo;s my brother, my best friend, and my forever creative partner.<br/><br/>
                            There&rsquo;s not much more to say about this one. I love this man, and the things we make together.<br/><br/>
                            SO!<br/><br/>
                            That was a couple hours spent writing about the people I love making things with the most in the world.<br/><br/>
                            It was soul-nourishing I can tell you that.<br/><br/>
                            I&rsquo;m a little burnt out from it to be fair &mdash; it was a write-it-in-one-go kind of thing. Gonna go eat some squash soup I made last night (for Mako, of all people!).<br/><br/>
                            Tell your creative partners how much you appreciate them. It will, hopefully, be soul-nourishing.<br/><br/>
                            </p>
