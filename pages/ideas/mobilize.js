                        <h4>Is the old approach to online fundraising for the charitable and nonprofit sector failing?</h4>
                        <p>How many young people (under 30) are on your mailing list?</p>
                        <p>For years the charitable and nonprofit sector have been relying on a deft mix of content, campaign, and email marketing to raise money.</p>
                        <p>1. Draw people in over time with content and campaigns.<br />
                        2. Steward donors with relevant mailing list content + other more personal touches.<br />
                        3. Call for donations when the time is right + the need is there.</p>
                        <p>But this (at least from what I&rsquo;m seeing) doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pulling in young donors. Donor attrition is happening as a matter of course, but replenishing lists with young/engaged donors isn&rsquo;t.</p>
                        <p>The old approach is showing signs of decay.</p>
                        <p>The problem is that connecting with and converting young people is a very different beast.</p>
                        <p>In this article I&rsquo;ll speak to the key three problems I see:<br />
                        1. Email isn&rsquo;t what you think it is.<br />
                        2. Follower &#8800; Donor<br />
                        3. The phenomena of community aid, GoFundMe, and kinship ties.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m doing this as social cause marketer whose worked with more than 80 nonprofits/social enterprises &mdash; yes.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m also doing it as a Gen Z myself, who spent an alarming amount of my screen-time on TikTok in the past year and who opens up Instagram first thing in the morning (not things I&rsquo;m proud of by the way &mdash; but if you can&rsquo;t be honest on LinkedIn where can you be).</p>
                        <p>After I point out the problems &mdash; I may even try to be an &ldquo;entrepreneur&rdquo; about it and propose some solutions.</p>
                        <p>My question for people/fundraisers in the nonprofit/charitable sector:</p>
                        <p>Is the foundation of this post built on the right analysis? Is this in fact a problem for you? Or am I making a big deal of natural ebs and flows?</p>
                        <p>As always, I&rsquo;m genuinely fascinated by any responses. If you EVER want to chat about engaging young people in your social cause/business just DM me. I&rsquo;m very much around.</p>

                        <p><strong>1. Email isn&rsquo;t what you think it is.</strong></p>
                        <p>What&rsquo;s your relationship with email?</p>
                        <p>For most young people, email has become a lot like snail mail:<br />
                        &bull; Mostly flyers<br />
                        &bull; Sometimes updates from relevant bureaucratic entities<br />
                        &bull; Never anything socially interesting<br />
                        &bull; Your Grandma&rsquo;s e-cards</p>
                        <p>The reality for young people is that:<br />
                        &bull; Most work gets done on things like Slack<br />
                        &bull; Social interactions go down on iMessage and Instagram DM<br />
                        &bull; Networking happens on LinkedIn<br />
                        &bull; Social planning goes down on Messenger</p>
                        <p>If you&rsquo;re a charity, nonprofit, or social enterprise &mdash; what group of activities do you want to situate yourself in?</p>
                        <p>Do you want to become the flyer that floods into an inbox with 3,604 unread emails (most young people don&rsquo;t care about getting to inbox zero because it doesn&rsquo;t matter that much)?</p>
                        <p>No, you want to situate yourself in spaces where people are connecting, growing, and planning.</p>
                        <p>Want to connect with young donors online? Great! Then dislodge the belief that email still plays a super important active role in their lives.</p>
                        <p>Instead, focus on positioning yourself effectively in the spaces we inhabit.</p>
                        <p>IMPORTANTLY, email still plays a vital role. In something like a crowd-funding campaign &mdash; email is still a super key tool. It&rsquo;s just not your only one. It may not even be your main one.</p>
                        <p>The PROBLEM though? You can&rsquo;t just replace &ldquo;joining the newsletter&rdquo; with &ldquo;follow us on Instagram&rdquo; as your main CTA. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that.</p>
                        <p>Later this week I&rsquo;ll explain why Followers &#8800; Donors &mdash; and what you can do to deal with that.</p>
                        <p>Again, if you ever want to chat about how to get young people mobilized around social causes through the right blend of creativity and strategy, DM me! I&rsquo;m open.</p>

                        <p><strong>2. Follower &#8800; donor.</strong></p>
                        <p>How do you build a &ldquo;Cause Community&rdquo;, digitally?</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s a really hard question &mdash; and it&rsquo;s one that we get a lot from potential clients. I&rsquo;ll tell you some tactics, but I want to start with the what and the why.</p>
                        <p>WHAT:<br />
                        Cause Community (noun).<br />
                        A group of people who are united in their care for your issue. Their connection is not only to you, but to each other. They are &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; names on your CRM. They show regular support &mdash; through donations, purchases, shares, and volunteerism.</p>
                        <p>WHY:<br />
                        Taking real time to develop a community of support, as opposed to a &ldquo;donor list&rdquo;, is worth it for three reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. Resilience.<br />
                        This community will stick with you. Maybe it&rsquo;s an economic downturn, maybe different issues rise to the top of the media ecosystem. A cause community is resilient to change &mdash; meaning your organization can be too.</p>
                        <p>2. Recurrence.<br />
                        Your goal with a &ldquo;Cause Community&rdquo; should be conversions to monthly donations/purchases. Recurring revenue is the foundation for innovation (social innovation included).</p>
                        <p>3. Reliability.<br />
                        You can go to this community when you need support &mdash; and expect it. The key to successful fundraising campaigns is activating the people who trust and love your work Start building that trust now.</p>
                        <p>HOW:<br />
                        This is real work. Community-building means getting on the ground, interacting, and storytelling (constantly).</p>
                        <p>But running a ton of Facebook ads will leave you with silicone supporters.</p>
                        <p>So here are some clear steps:<br />
                        1. Storytelling as the foundation.<br />
                        You need to find a great brand or campaign message that will help you carve out a special spot in your supporter&rsquo;s brain. Then, you need to get really good at telling that story beautifully, over and over again &mdash; digitally and in person.</p>
                        <p>(and I&rsquo;m just going to shamelessly plug here because it&rsquo;s LinkedIn and you can all guess why I&rsquo;m writing this post: this is what My Media Creative is really good at &mdash; you should work with us).</p>
                        <p>2. Direct engagement with followers.<br />
                        Instagram followers &#8800; supporters &mdash; BUT you can do some work to drive conversion. When someone follows you, message them. Ask them how they came about your cause. Start a bit of a conversation about their interests, likes, and dislikes.</p>
                        <p>Then, when you have some sort of CTA go back to them in your DMs and send it. They&rsquo;ll feel more compelled to engage because they&rsquo;ve talked to you before (and, you&rsquo;ll more likely end up in their Primary DM inbox).</p>
                        <p>3. Spokesperson marketing + community engagement.<br />
                        Use your people as brand-champions on social and IRL as much as possible. People like talking to people, not brands. The only catch: you need to get REALLY good at telling the story.</p>
                        <p>4. Events.<br />
                        This is obvious I think: meet people. Gather them. Provide a compelling reason for them to come out and basically just chill together (digitally and in-person). Don&rsquo;t build didactic programming &mdash; build fun and interactive experiences.</p>
                        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to this &mdash; but I&rsquo;m running up against LinkedIn&rsquo;s word limit. DM me if you want to chat more.</p>

                        <p><strong>3. GoFundMe and Community Support.</strong></p>
                        <p>Youth are donating! Just not in the way you think.</p>
                        <p>In 2020, 2/3 Instagram stories that I saw were about a social cause. Interestingly, GoFundMe campaigns, PayPal addresses, Venmos &mdash; and other requests for community aid are the most common form of donation solicitation that exist in my social media ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>What does this say?</p>
                        <p>The most interesting thing for me, honestly, is that they are stepping in to provide a social safety net. Many solicitations for community support ask for funds to offset the cost of things that should be covered by governments. I think that the need and success of these campaigns comes down to a couple key &ldquo;truisms&rdquo; that run through more progressive groups of young people:<br />
                        1. Capitalism is ruthless, and often unjust.<br />
                        2. Opportunity, and thereby economic security, has been destroyed or made inaccessible for many folks.<br />
                        3. The government is failing to offset these economic issues.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it becomes the responsibility of the community to provide aid where systems have failed. It&rsquo;s genuinely a fascinating phenomenon &mdash; especially considering that it is often paired with a very legitimate and well articulated critique/mistrust of modern-day philanthropy/charity.</p>
                        <p>The crux of this critique is simple (and well known to many):<br />
                        1. Philanthropy is still a pretty centralized practice for the powerful.<br />
                        2. Donating to charities only addresses the symptom, but doesn&rsquo;t attack the ailment (structural injustice).<br />
                        3. Worse yet, donating to charities allows us to feel better and provides fodder that can be used to decrease pressure on powerful institutions to address structural injustice.</p>
                        <p>Basically, charity/philanthropy in the way that it&rsquo;s done doesn&rsquo;t empower the kind of structural change we need to undertake &mdash; in fact, in some cases, it hinders it.</p>
                        <p>The emergence of community aid as an alternative seems to allow for a practice of donating to exist within this framework.</p>
                        <p>What should the social sector do about this? I&rsquo;m genuinely not sure yet. This is just what I&rsquo;m seeing. But, I want to make sure that we don&rsquo;t dismiss these critiques or simply mime out these values to attract young audiences.</p>
                        <p>This goes beyond marketing, and forces us to ask what the purpose of the social sector should be in the 21st century. That&rsquo;s a longer discussion.</p>
